Recently I've been trying to cook more at home because I spend way too much money on eating out. The only problem is that I can only make different kinds of pasta. 

I've been binge watching Shameless all weekend and I've gotten through about 4 seasons. This is also the second time I've watched this show. Its one of my faves. 

I had Torchys for lunch today and I bought an extra taco to eat for dinner tonight. My plan of cooking more is not looking good so far.
