**My Life**.
I grew up in Magnolia, Texas and I lived there up until I left for college. I come from a family of 5 and I have one brother and one sister. My brother is in law school and my sister lives in Florida with her husband and baby. My niece, Abigail is the cutest little baby and I love being her aunt! My parents both work in real estate and they live in Florida selling property in our favorite vacation spot, Rosemary Beach.
