This page is about me!
I'm 22 years old and I go to Texas A&M University. I'm from Houston, Texas and I come from a family of 5. 
I have a dog named Charlie and she is my best friend!
I am a Communication major and I hope to get a job in the marketing field. 
I'm sad that college is coming to an end but I'm excited for whats to come!
That's just a little about me.
